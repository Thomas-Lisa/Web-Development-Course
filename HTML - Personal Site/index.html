        <h1>Thomas Lisa</h1>
        <p><em>Student of <strong>NWCTA</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>
            I am a high school senior at Northwest CTA. My education thus far has focused on engineering and design, 
            though time has been spent in all of the STEM disciplines. My college focus will likely be in computer science, 
            where I hope to learn skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My career goals include working
            with the nation's leading organizations (such as the US DoD, Raytheon Co., and BAE Systems) on furthering the
            world's technology in national defence and safety. During the summer of '22, I virtually attended the MIT
            Beaver Works Summer Institute, wherein I worked with a team of 3 other students to develop a video game that could
            model disease propagation and government methods of containment in the real world. From there, we also developed a
            rudimentary machine learning model that was then used to understand the relationship of human and AI performance
            in disease prevention.
